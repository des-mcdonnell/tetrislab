            As digital information systems become more prevalent in our lives,
            the need to receive status updates and other forms of notifications
            from the applications we rely on has increased significantly. As
            autonomous AI agents become more prevalent, it is expected that this
            requirement will only increase. This study aims to investigate the
            impact of these notifications on flow state and the performance of
            primary cognitive tasks.

            asked to complete a web-based experiment. You will be requested to
            play a game of Tetris (Primary Task). The score you achieve and the
            time taken to complete this task will be recorded and later
            analysed. If you are randomly selected to be part of one of two
            intervention cohorts, you will be exposed to interfering stimuli in
            the form of either a series of passive or active UI notifications.
            Passive notifications will temporarily appear onscreen and can be
            ignored while active notifications will require your attention and
            interaction.{" "}

            Under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) the legal
            basis for collecting data for scholarly research is that of public
            interest. The regulations regarding the protection of your data will
            be followed. Only data which is needed for analysis will be
            collected. By giving your consent to take part in the study you are
            consenting to the use of your data as detailed in this information
            sheet. The data will be retained by the researcher for at least one
            year and may be retained for up to 7 years if the results of the
            study are published in certain capacities (e.g. in a journal
            article). There is also a possibility that the fully anonymised
            dataset may be submitted to a journal and made available to other
            researchers and academics worldwide for verification purposes, but
            if this occurs it will be ensured that you are not identifiable from
            the data.

            On completion, data will be exported and stored in encrypted form on
            password-protected computers only. If a data breach occurs at any
            point, the data protection officer in IADT will be informed
            immediately. All data collected and stored will be fully anonymous
