        As digital information systems become more prevalent in our lives, the
        need to receive status updates and other forms of notifications from the
        applications we rely on has increased significantly. As autonomous AI
        agents become more prevalent, it is expected that this requirement will
        only increase. This study aims to investigate the impact of these
        notifications on flow state and the performance of primary cognitive
        tasks.

          If you are randomly selected to be part of one of two intervention

          either passive or active UI notifications.
        </Typography>
        <Typography sx={{ mb: 2 }}>
          Passive notifications may periodically appear in the bottom right

          Active notifications may periodically appear in the middle of your
          screen. While this notifications are visible, the primary task will be
          paused. Active notifications will require a response to continue. You
          can response by clicking either &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; with
          your mouse.

          On completion of the primary task, you will be asked to complete the
          Flow State Scale (FSS-2) questionnaire. This will comprise of 36
          questions related to any flow state experienced during the primary
          task. Responses will be based on a likert rating scale.
