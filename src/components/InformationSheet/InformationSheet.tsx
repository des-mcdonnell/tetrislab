        <AccordionDetails>
          As digital information systems become more prevalent in our lives, the
          need to receive status updates and other forms of notifications from
          the applications we rely on has increased significantly. As autonomous
          AI agents become more prevalent, it is expected that this requirement
          will only increase. This study aims to investigate the impact of these
          notifications on flow state and the performance of primary cognitive
          tasks.

            If you choose to proceed as a participant in this study you will be
            asked to complete a web-based experiment. You will be requested to
            play a game of Tetris (Primary Task). The score you achieve and the
            time taken to complete this task will be recorded and later
            analysed. If you are randomly selected to be part of one of two
            intervention cohorts, you will be exposed to interfering stimuli in
            the form of either a series of passive or active UI notifications.
            Passive notifications will temporarily appear onscreen and can be
            ignored while active notifications will require your attention and
            interaction.{" "}

            Under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) the legal

            interest. The regulations regarding the protection of your data will
            be followed. Only data which is needed for analysis will be
            collected. By giving your consent to take part in the study you are
            consenting to the use of your data as detailed in this information
            sheet. The data will be retained by the researcher for at least one
            year and may be retained for up to 7 years if the results of the
            study are published in certain capacities (e.g. in a journal
            article). There is also a possibility that the fully anonymised
            dataset may be submitted to a journal and made available to other
            researchers and academics worldwide for verification purposes, but
            if this occurs it will be ensured that you are not identifiable from
            the data.

            As the supervisor on this project, I, Dr Liam Challenor, am
            responsible for ensuring that all datasets will be stored in

            to a journal will be fully deleted on or before{" "}

            Throughout the study and during the thesis evaluation period data
            collected will be accessible to the researcher, Des McDonnell and
            supervisor, Dr Liam Challenor only. While participants are
            completing the study, data will be stored in a cloud-based database.
            On completion, data will be exported and stored in encrypted form on
            password-protected computers only. If a data breach occurs at any
            point, the data protection officer in IADT will be informed
            immediately. All data collected and stored will be fully anonymous
            with no identifiable properties. On or before the
